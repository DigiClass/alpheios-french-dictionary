Present: Bridget (BA), Philippe (PV), MR

**Topics covered**

- in the Eulexis correction tool, it will be important to distinguish/keep a trace of provenance wrt user input (original version vs edited one). To be seen/decided how this implemented; important to reduce need for user input so as to keep the process as quick as possible. 
- BA: open question for alpheios dictionary tool -> how to display in the interface besides short defs. also the different nouns derivated from the main lemma (often adjectives) 
- BA to align shorts french definitions for alpheios directly with Eulexis data (instead of bailly/LSJ as it is right now)
- PV to add a column to the CSV files with frequency of each lemma



- sketch of the correction workflow
  - only one source of files, in GitHub, with batches of 100 (tbc) definitions
  - minimal spreadsheet to log activities, shared with all participants
  - use dropbox to upload the finished text files, as alternative to having participants checking them into GH (to lower technical entry barrier)
  - next goal: try a pilot workflow among three of us, even on a small data sample, then review with/explain to the others

**Actions**:

- MR to set up the spreadsheet 
- PV finalise Eulexis correction tool
