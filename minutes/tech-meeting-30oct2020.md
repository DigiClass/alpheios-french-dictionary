30.10.20

Present: BA, PV, MR

**Notes**:

- aim of the correction interface is to have a one-liner definition; corrections to en/fr/de are possible
- behaviour of correction window: default to Bailly's def; if Bailly's def is missing, default to Eulexis
- there is no going back to prev. Entry, but if reloading/reopening the file the user will start over again.
- 100 entries take ~1h to correct. We go for batches of 25 (~15mins). To be tested/checked if it's enough or too little. We need to find a good balance to keep the "momentum" of correction activity going.  
- we start the correction from the ~6k terms occurring >= 100 times

**Next**

- PV finishes the interface (changes of buttons vs checkboxes) and makes available Mac version
- MR tests the correction workflow in Eulexis it and writes a short tutorial => PV/BA(?) review it
